# Flaskr Blog

This project was created following the Flaskr tutorial on the Flask website.

Ideas for taking the project further:
- A detail view to show a single post. Click a post's title to go to its page.
- Like / unlike a post
- Comments
- Tags. Clicking a tag shows all the posts with that tag.
- A search box that filters the index page by name.
- Paged display. Only show 5 posts per page.
- Upload an image to go along with a post.
- Format posts using Markdown
- An RSS feed of new posts.
