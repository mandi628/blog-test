# Blog Test CHANGELOG

This is an attempt to create a blog website fromt scratch, without any other software. 
I am using instructions from ChatGPT.

2025.03.30 The previous attempt did not work. I am starting over, using instructions from
flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/tutorial (Flask official documentation).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.0] - 2024.10.22

### Added

- Set up file structure.
- Set up Node.js with Express, per instructions. It worked but did not save blog posts correctly.
- Attempted to set up MongoDB for post storage, but something failed. I'm not sure what.
